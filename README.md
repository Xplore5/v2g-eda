# V2G EDA: Vehicle-to-Grid Exploratory Data Analysis

Comprehensive exploratory data analysis and demand response modeling for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) optimizations, focusing on EV charging patterns, user behavior analysis, and grid integration strategies.

## üìã Project Overview

This project analyzes EV charging transaction data from January-June 2025 to understand charging patterns, identify optimization opportunities, and develop demand response strategies for Vehicle-to-Grid systems. The analysis covers 196,580+ charging transactions across multiple zones and charging sites.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive EDA**: Time-series analysis, temporal patterns, and usage trends
- **Customer Segmentation**: User behavior clustering and persona identification
- **Demand Response Strategy**: Peak-hour throttling candidate identification
- **Grid Integration Analysis**: Site utilization, zone-based load distribution
- **Revenue Modeling**: V2G discharge potential and dynamic pricing analysis
- **Retention Analysis**: Customer loyalty and repeat usage patterns

### Key Findings

- **Temporal Patterns**: Peak demand occurs on weekday evenings (18:00-22:00) with weekend demand more evenly distributed
- **Geographic Distribution**: West and Central zones dominate both session counts and energy delivery
- **User Behavior**: High session duration variability with median ~2 hours but long tail extending to multi-day charging
- **Seasonal Trends**: Increasing demand trend from January through June, particularly strong in May-June
- **Customer Retention**: Only ~8% of customers used charging services all 6 months, suggesting need for improved loyalty programs
